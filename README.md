# Fast is-even

This package gives an isEven function that is a little bit faster than most alternatives. This speed is achieved by using an algorithm that uses fewer operations than standard implenentations - though this comes at the cost of accuracy, as this will only give a correct answer about 50% of the time.

### Usage: 
```js
import isEven from "fastIsEven"

console.log(isEven(0)) // true
console.log(isEven(1)) // true
console.log(isEven(2)) // true
```

# Do not actually use this

This package is intended to be humorous, a joke based on how many packages there are that seem pointless. It is probably best you don't use it.
